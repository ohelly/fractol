# fractol
## Description
Fractol is a project aimed at exploring fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale.
**For more details regarding the project see [subject.en.pdf](https://github.com/ohelly/fractol/blob/master/subject.en.pdf).**
## Features
* Switch between fractls : Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship.
* Increase and decrease max iteration for shape calculation.
* Zoom and unzoom.
* Different colors patterns.
## Compiling and running
```sh
$ make
$ ./fractol
```
or
```sh
$ make
$ ./fractol [fractol]
```
 Possible fractals are: ```Mandelbrot```, ```Julia```, ```Burningship```.
